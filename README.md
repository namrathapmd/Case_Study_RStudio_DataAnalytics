## Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share company Navigate Speedy Success?
In this case study, I analyze historical data from a fictional bike-share company, Cyclistic in order to identify trends in how customers use bikes differently using R and RStudio IDE. This case study is a capstone project as a part of my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course.

## Scenario

Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago with two types of customers. Customers who purchased single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders and customers who purchased annual memberships are referred to as members. The finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual ridders. The Director of Marketing believes that maximizing the number of annual members is key to the companyâ€™s success and future growth.

The marketing analyst team wants to understand how the casual riders and members use the bikes differently and how they can use that to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. The primary stakeholders of the company are the director of marketing and the Cyclistic Executive Team.

You have just joined the Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team as a Junior Data Analyst and are tasked with identifying trends and analyzing the customer bike usage in order to help Cyclistic achieve their goals.
